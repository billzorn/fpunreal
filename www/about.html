<p>Titanic is an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754</a>
  floating point arithmetic in terms of real numbers. It is suitable as a reference; though it is
  much slower than numerical libraries such as <a href="https://gmplib.org/">GMP</a> and
  <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, Titanic has a very simple implementation
  and is naturally immune to quantization error due to floating point rounding.</p>

<p>Typical numerical libraries use a binary implementation of floating point for maximum
  performance. However, the IEEE 754 standard is specified in terms of real numbers. Ensuring
  that the behavior of a discrete program lines up with this continuous specification can be
  difficult.</p>

<p>One way of thinking about a specific IEEE 754 floating point format with some precision is as a map from
  bit patterns to a set of real numbers. But it is also a map from a set of intervals that
  cover the real line, or "rounding envelopes," to the single representative number chosen
  for each interval.</p>

<p>Given a number, Titanic can efficiently find the interval in some floating point format
  that contains that number. Given a computation, Titanic can find the interval
  that contains the real value of the result. Because it uses real numbers, Titanic can implement
  the IEEE 754 specification directly, without having to reason about the behavior of a binary
  representation.</p>

<p>Titanic is effectively an "infinite precision" floating point implementation: given any
  computation and any floating point format, it will either produce a correctly rounded answer
  or exhaust its available computing resources and report that it has failed. It is guaranteed
  to float correctly.</p>

<h2 id="constants">floating point constants</h2>

<p>Titanic will tell you everything you could possibly want to know about a number
  in an IEEE 754 floating point format of any precision, or about how any real number
  would be represented in such a format.</p>

<h3 id="input">providing input to Titanic</h3>

<p>Titanic needs two kinds of input: some representation of a number, and the precision of the
  IEEE 754 floating point format that number will be represented in.</p>

<h3 id="output">undertanding Titanic's output</h3>

<p>Depending on the input, Titanic will provide a range of information.</p>
