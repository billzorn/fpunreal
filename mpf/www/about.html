<p style="font-size:24px;color:red;">Work in Progress: This vessel is not yet seaworthy!</p>

<p>Titanic takes in real numbers, and tells you everything you could possibly want to know about how they will be represented in IEEE 754 standard compliant floating point formats. You can give it any real number you can specify, and any number of bits you fancy, and it will either give you correct or information or exhaust its available compute resources and fail. It is guaranteed to float correctly.</p>

<p>Titanic is implemented in Python and uses the <a href="http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html">SymPy</a> library.</p>

<p>Currently, Titanic is in the prototype phase, and it may suffer from bugs, particularly in the way information is dispayed. If something seems wrong, it may be prudent to check it with a tool such as <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha</a>.</p>

<p>For the curious, here are some very early drafts of the theories upon which Titanic is based.</p>
